# Sarah Backend

Acts as a Slack Bot and Custom SFMC Content Block backend service. Runs in AWS using Lambda, S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and SSM

## Software/Service Prerequisites

- AWS Account https://aws.amazon.com/account/
- OpenAI Account https://openai.com/
- Microsoft Azure Account https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/
- Slack App https://api.slack.com/start
- nodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/
- SST https://sst.dev/
- AWS CLI https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

## Getting started

- Populate the environment file in AWS Systems Manager (SSM). This will create the .env file used by the APIStack.ts code. The expected name for the parameter store name is `sarahbot` but can be updated in the build-env.js file at the root directory.
